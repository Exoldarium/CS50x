Scrabble!

## General info

This one was interesting. Considering that each char can be converted to a ascii decimal we can find the corresponding letter by substracting from the last letter in the alphabet. The only thing that is left is finding the correct point in the points array that was provided.  

## Installation
Run on Mac or Linux
```bash
make scrabble.c
./scrabble
```
Run on Windows - Run build task in your terminal or simply press Ctrl+Shift+B
```bash
./scrabble
```

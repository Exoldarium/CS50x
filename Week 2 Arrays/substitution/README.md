Cipher!

## General info

I think this was the first cipher i ever created, it was pretty fun i have to say. The problem was a great practice for arrays in C as i've only worked with arrays in JavaScript before, it is a bit different but not too dissimilar.

## Installation
Run on Mac or Linux
```bash
make substitution.c
./substitution
```
Run on Windows - Run build task in your terminal or simply press Ctrl+Shift+B
```bash
./substitution
```

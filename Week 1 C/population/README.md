LLamas!

## General info

It was a fun problem to solve. This is the first time i have used C so it took me some time to get a hang of it but it was a very good practice. I'm storing the total number of
years that the population needs to reach the maximum in a variable. For each loop the counter will increase by one. The starting population has to larger or equal to 9 in order
for the population of LLamas to increse and the ending population needs to be greater or equal to the starting population. If the user inputs the incorrect number they will be prompted until they provide a correct input.

## Installation
Run on Mac or Linux
```bash
make population.c
./population
```
Run on Windows - Run build task in your terminal or simply press Ctrl+Shift+B
```bash
./population
```

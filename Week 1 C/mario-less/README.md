It's-a-me!

## General info

This one was interesting. I got stuck for a moment on reversing the pyramid but once i split the problem into smaller pices it was easier to solve. I started looping only once and trying to get the correct position of the block. Once that was settled it was easier to add more blocks by tracking where my loops was with the counter.

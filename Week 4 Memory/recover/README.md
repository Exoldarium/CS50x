CSI!

## General info

Pretty hard, almost as hard as runoff. I got stuck figuring out how to solve where one jpg images starts and ends and when to start and stop writing new files. In the end i realized that i have to call fopen everytime i open a new file and close the previous one before opening the next one. 

## Installation
Run on Mac or Linux
```bash
make recover.c
./recover
```
Run on Windows - Run build task in your terminal or simply press Ctrl+Shift+B
```bash
./recover
```

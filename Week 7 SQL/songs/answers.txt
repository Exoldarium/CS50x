If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Purple
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Personally, it's not the type of music i listen to. I don't think you can tell someone's aura just from music they are listening. Of course we can calculate many things, but
in the end each person is different, choosing arbitrary values, or colours in this case is too limiting.

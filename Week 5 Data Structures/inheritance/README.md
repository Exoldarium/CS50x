Inheritance!

## General info

Pointers are hard. I found it helpful to create an image of nodes in my head and trace the line where each of the pointers should point and connect the nodes. In the end it all came together.

## Installation
Run on Mac or Linux
```bash
make inheritance.c
./inheritance
```
Run on Windows - Run build task in your terminal or simply press Ctrl+Shift+B
```bash
./inheritance
```

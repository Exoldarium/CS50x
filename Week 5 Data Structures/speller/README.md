Speller!

## General info

Truth be told, i didn't really try to optimize the hash function and i left it as it was. This one was probably the hardest one for me, well aside from recover pset i had to go back and read more about pointers in order to understand how to solve it.

## Installation

```bash
make speller.c
./speller
```
Run on Windows - Run build task in your terminal or simply press Ctrl+Shift+B

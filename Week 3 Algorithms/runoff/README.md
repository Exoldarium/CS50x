Elections!

## General info

The hardest one so far. I completed 90% of the code without realizing that my bubble sort algorithm wasn't finding the minimum correctly. Took my far too long
to realize that that was the problem. After changing the approach the rest of the code came together more quickly.

## Installation
Run on Mac or Linux
```bash
make runoff.c
./runoff
```
Run on Windows - Run build task in your terminal or simply press Ctrl+Shift+B
```bash
./runoff
```
